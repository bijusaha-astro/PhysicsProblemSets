# PhysicsProblemSets
a repo of physics problem sets for physics lecturers/teachers 

***

Make a pull request (PR) to a corresponding folder. 

**Example** if you have problem sets in stellar phyiscs -- add it to the Astro folder.
If you have problemsets that are in some other branch of physics - let me now when you make a PR and I will create it.

Structure is:

# HEP
# ASTRO
# COSMO

Best,
Niko
